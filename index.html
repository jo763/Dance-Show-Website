        <h3>Time Warp Routine Session 1 (Pre-Chorus, Chorus and Hook 1) - 14/01/2022</h3>
        <p>Thank you for all that attended the session yesterday.
          We covered the choreography for hook 1, 2 and 3, the pre-chorus and the chorus (recorded). We explored some of the type of lifts/tricks likely to appear in the routine as well as very briefly covering hook 5 and the ending scene.
          Next week, we will recap for those who couldnâ€™t attend, and polish what we have learnt, formalising timings and techniques. We will properly go over hook 5 and the ending scene as well as learn verse 3 and the modifications to the second chorus. If time permits, we will also learn hook 3.
