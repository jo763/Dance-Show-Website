        <h3>Time Warp Routine Session 2 (Chorus 1, 2, verse 2, 3, hook 1, 2, 3,5, and ending) - 21/01/2022</h3>
        <p>Thank you to all those who attended yesterday. We covered a lot of content, with the vast majority of the choreography covered.  Next week, we’ll be looking at drilling the routine and polishing whilst finishing off the remaining bits to learn. We’ll also be looking into individual couple parts.</p>
        <p>We may also look into a second routine, depending on progress. Well done on learning the routine! It’s not an easy one.</p>

        <h3>Time Warp Routine Session 1 (Pre-Chorus, Chorus and Hook 1) - 14/01/2022</h3>
        <p>Thank you for all that attended the session yesterday.
          We covered the choreography for hook 1, 2 and 3, the pre-chorus and the chorus (recorded). We explored some of the type of lifts/tricks likely to appear in the routine as well as very briefly covering hook 5 and the ending scene.
          Next week, we will recap for those who couldn’t attend, and polish what we have learnt, formalising timings and techniques. We will properly go over hook 5 and the ending scene as well as learn verse 3 and the modifications to the second chorus. If time permits, we will also learn hook 3.
